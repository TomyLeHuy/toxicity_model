# Overview
A basic webapp that allows the user to type in comments to be graded by a deep learning model. The used training CSV files can't be uploaded but the model is already trained and ready to be used.
## Running the Project
In order to run the app just open the folder in an IDE of you choice (i suggest pyCharm) and install the required packages:
``` py
pip install requirements.txt
cd 
python manage.py runserver
```
## Feedback
